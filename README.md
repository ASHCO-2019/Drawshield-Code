# Drawshield-Code

This is a large PHP program which takes as input a text argument of a heraldic blazon and returns an SVG image of the heraldic shield described by that blazon. For example, and input of _Azure, a bend or._ will return an image of a blue shield with a diagonal yellow stripe running from top left to bottom right.
